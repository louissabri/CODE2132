            My facade design draws direct inspiration from the images on the Pinterest board. The interplay of light and shadow created by the metal fins in those images captivated me. I sought to recreate that dynamic shading effect in my design, ensuring the building not only looks aesthetically appealing but also provides functional shading.

            The metal fins give the facade a sleek, modern look. Their vertical alignment and subtle curves add a sense of fluidity and movement, much like the examples I found on Pinterest. These fins create an ever-changing visual experience as the sun moves, enhancing the building's aesthetic appeal throughout the day.

            My research into circular building layouts significantly informed and inspired my floor plan design. Analysing these floor plans helped me integrate a centralised building core with essential features like lifts, staircases, toilets, and kitchens. This design ensures efficient circulation and maximises space use while promoting equal access to natural light and ventilation.

            The benefits of an open plan office include fostering collaboration, improving communication, and offering workspace flexibility. However, inspired by the layouts on shown on the Pinterest board, I incorporated separate meeting rooms to provide private spaces for focused work and confidential discussions. This balance enhances productivity and caters to diverse working styles in a modern office environment.
